## üî• Projects I've Worked On

### Project 1: [HiMSEN Engine Abnormality Detection Analysis](https://github.com/sepengsu/HiMSEN)
- Based on the knowledge from the courses taken, preprocess the HiMSEN engine fault data, separate the data by mode and by four different systems, analyze it, and implement a fault diagnosis and cause system algorithm using ANN
- Role: Understanding Data Characteristics (Temperature, Pressure)  
        Data Preprocessing

### Project 2: [Monthly Dacon Machine Failure Diagnosis AI Contest](https://github.com/sepengsu/DACON-machine-fault-diagnosis)
- Participated in a project individually, extracted statistical features from sound in both time and frequency domains, preprocessed the data after separating it by mode (0,2), and implemented a machine fault diagnosis algorithm by ensembling IF (Isolation Forest), OCSVM (One-Class SVM), and AE (AutoEncoder)

### Project 3: [TOC in CCTV](https://github.com/INISW/INISW6)
- A project implemented as a multi-stage model of Tracking + Super-Resolution + image-captioning with the goal of text conversion
of video. Used Yolo4Deepsort (Yolo4), SwinIR (Swin Transformer), and BLIP (vit-encoder + cross attention + LM-decoder) respectively.
- Role: Super-resolution (select model)
  Image-captioning (select model and finetuning)

### Project 4: [Development of an FDM process quality prediction model based on ANN and transfer learning for material response](Project Link)
- Participated in the 8th Precision Engineering Creative Competition as an undergraduate researcher in Professor Sangwon Lee's
laboratory, along with graduate students. Developed a quality prediction model for the FDM process for composite materials
(ABS, PLA, PETG) based on ANN and transfer learning
- Role: Data collection and preprocessing  
Quality Prediction modeling  
Make poster and presentation

### Project 5: [Vision inspection system for clothing fabric based on image object segmentation algorithm]
- Participated in a system development project to inspect fabric defects (stain, hole, dyeing) using a vision camera and deep
learning as an undergraduate research student. Achieved Acc 95.31%, IOU 0.902, and Inference time 54FPS with the deep
learning image object segmentation model U-net++ and ensemble and threshold algorithms
- Role: Paper review  
Code review  
Image Data Collection  
Data Labeling and Preprocessing  

### Project 6: [Development of an anomaly detection algorithm based on
multimodal learning for CNC tool wear recognition and monitoring](https://github.com/sepengsu/Smart_Factory)
- For a capstone project, developed a CNC tool wear recognition and replacement notification algorithm by applying an
ensemble model based on unsupervised and supervised learning, and a Rule-based model in stages. Unsupervised learning
used clustering (Agglomerative method), ensemble (with anomaly detection and sampling techniques applied), a CNN
classification model based on STFT images, and a Rule-based mode
- Role: Paper review (RUL and Anomaly detection)  
Code review (DAMP algorithm)  
EDA (t-test, MFCC use)  
Data Labeling and Preprocessing  
Model Selection  
Sampling Method (over and undersampling)  
Model train and test

### Project 7: [Reinforcement learning algorithm and gait simulation based on the SCONE program](https://github.com/sepengsu/winter_co_op)
- As part of a CO-OP project, carried out a normal person's Gait simulation using the gait simulation program SCONE and
reinforcement learning algorithms. The DEP(controller)-MPO(reinforcement learning) algorithm was used, and a PD controller
was utilized to maintain the balance of the upper body. Additionally, by modifying the walking model to automatically
maintain balance, performance was further improved
- Role: Paper and Code review
Coding and model Customize
Model Selection
Customize reward function and pd controller
