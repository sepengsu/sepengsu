## üî• Projects I've Worked On

### Project 1: [HiMSEN Engine Abnormality Detection Analysis](https://github.com/sepengsu/HiMSEN)
- Based on the knowledge from the courses taken, preprocess the HiMSEN engine fault data, separate the data by mode and by four different systems, analyze it, and implement a fault diagnosis and cause system algorithm using ANN
- Role: Understanding Data Characteristics (Temperature, Pressure)  
        Data Preprocessing

### Project 2: [Monthly Dacon Machine Failure Diagnosis AI Contest](https://github.com/sepengsu/DACON-machine-fault-diagnosis)
- Participated in a project individually, extracted statistical features from sound in both time and frequency domains, preprocessed the data after separating it by mode (0,2), and implemented a machine fault diagnosis algorithm by ensembling IF (Isolation Forest), OCSVM (One-Class SVM), and AE (AutoEncoder)

### Project 3: [TOC in CCTV](https://github.com/INISW/INISW6)
- A project implemented as a multi-stage model of Tracking + Super-Resolution + image-captioning with the goal of text conversion
of video. Used Yolo4Deepsort (Yolo4), SwinIR (Swin Transformer), and BLIP (vit-encoder + cross attention + LM-decoder) respectively.
- Role: Super-resolution (select model)
  Image-captioning (select model and finetuning)
